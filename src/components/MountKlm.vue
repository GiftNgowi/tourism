              </p>
              <p>
                The Marangu Route, also known as the "Coca Cola" or tourist
                route, is the simplest and shortest way to reach Kilimanjaro's
                summit. It provides solar-powered sleeping huts with comfortable
                beds and basic amenities such as restrooms and running water.
                Climbing groups from all over the world share communal dining
                huts where they can buy soft drinks, bottled water, and beer.
                The standard route takes five days, but an extra day for
                acclimatization can be added.

              </p>
              <p>
                The Machame route, also known as the Whiskey route, is the most
                popular route on Kilimanjaro. It has scenic beauty but is
                considered difficult and steep, making it better suited for
                experienced hikers. The approach is from the south, through the
                rainforest to the Shira Plateau, then beneath the Southern Ice
                Field to Barafu. Plan Africa Adventures provides a seven-day
                group climb as well as a six-day private climb with a shortened
                itinerary.

              </p>
              <p>
                The Rongai Route is the only approach to Kilimanjaro from the
                north, known for its scenic beauty, ease of trekking, and high
                success rate. Unlike the Marangu Route, it uses tents for
                sleeping and dining. Meals are served in a dinner tent or
                outside on a blanket, and porters pitch the tents. The route has
                a gradual slope and is less travelled. The Rongai joins the
                Marangu Route for the summit climb and descends via the
                southeast side, providing multiple viewpoints of Kilimanjaro.
